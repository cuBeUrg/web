        <p> Microsoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation.[36] That project was not completed but the name lives on.
            The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.[37] This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++. </p>
